# Deep Learning in Finance

Deep Learning, a start of the art methodology used to deal with huge amount of data and can handle both supervised and unsupervised data. 
The amazing part of this Deep Learning is that it uses Neural Netwroks - an interconnected web of nodes and the edges that join them together. 
It has a potential to learn the features and reduce errors through Forward propogation and Backward propogation. 
The errors are minimised through Gradient Descent techniques.

#### Applications of Deep Learning
> Sentiment Analysis <br>
> Named Entity Recognition <br>
> Image Recognition <br>
> Object Recognition <br>
> Speech Recognition <br>
> Time Series Analysis and many more...<br>


#### Deep Learning Applications in Finance
> Stock Market Prediction <br>
> Financial Security <br>
> Automation Process <br>
> Analysing Trading Strategies <br>
> Loan Application Evaluation <br>
> Credit Card Customer Research and many more... <br>

Companies like CRISIL, JP Morgan Chase, BNY Mello and others are using Deep Learning Frameworks in their financial fields.<br>

Here we will be discussing about Stock Market Prediction.
Stock Market Prediction 
Here, we try to predict the direction of market(uptrend or downtrend) using a set of features, thus we can consider it as a Binary Classification problem i.e <br>
> 0 => Downtrend <br>
> 1 => Uptrend

##### Steps
1. *Getting the system ready and loading the data*
2. *Dataset Content understanding*
3. *Preprocessing the Data*
4. *Feature Extraction*
5. *Feature Scaling*
6. *Creating the model*
7. *Calculating the error metrics*
